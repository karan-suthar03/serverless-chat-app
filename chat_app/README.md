# Chat App

A cross-platform chat application built with Flutter and Firebase.


## Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (ensure it's added to your PATH)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (usually included with Flutter)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (for managing Firebase projects)
- [FlutterFire CLI](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/cli/) (for generating config files)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for mobile builds
- A configured Firebase project (see below)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone <repo-url>
cd chat_app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```
flutter pub get
```


### 3. Firebase Configuration (with FlutterFire CLI)

This project uses Firebase for authentication and backend services. Sensitive config files are **not** tracked in version control (see `.gitignore`).

#### 3.1. Install FlutterFire CLI (if not already)
```
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```

#### 3.2. Login and Configure
```
flutterfire configure
```
Follow the prompts to select your Firebase project and platforms. This will generate the `lib/firebase_options.dart` file and update platform config files.

#### 3.3. Add Platform Config Files
- Android: Place your `google-services.json` in `android/app/` (FlutterFire CLI may do this for you).
- iOS: Place your `GoogleService-Info.plist` in `ios/Runner/`.
- Web: Config is included in `lib/firebase_options.dart`.
- macOS/Windows/Linux: Ensure your Firebase project supports your target platform. See [FlutterFire docs](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview/).

### 4. Run the App

#### Android/iOS
```
flutter run
```

#### Web
```
flutter run -d chrome
```

#### Windows/macOS/Linux
```
flutter run -d windows   # or macos, linux
```

## Notes

- The file `lib/firebase_options.dart` is generated by the FlutterFire CLI and should match your Firebase project.
- API endpoints are configured in `lib/api/api_client.dart`.
- Do **not** commit your Firebase config or secret files.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter dependency issues, run:
	```
	flutter pub get
	flutter clean
	flutter pub get
	```
- For platform-specific errors, ensure you have the correct SDKs and emulators installed.
